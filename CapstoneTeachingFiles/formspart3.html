    <!-- Things we will cover
    1. Linking Radio Buttons
    2. Drop-down Menus
    3. Text Area inputs -->


    <!-- RADIO INPUTS!! -->
    <!-- A 'radio' input is like a multiple choice question -->
    <!-- To work, you need the type='radio', and the same name attribute for all 'questions' -->
    <!-- If you have a label, you also need an id attribute -->
    <form method="get">
        <h3>Do you already own a dog?</h3>
        <label for="yes">Yes</label>
        <input type="radio" id="yes" name="dog_choice" value="yes">


        <label for="no">No:</label>
        <input type="radio" id="no" name= "dog_choice" value="no">


        <!-- SELECT -->
        <!-- The dropdown is not an input type, but rather it's own tag -->
        <!-- To work, you have the select tag with a name attribute -->
        <!-- Then within the opening/closing select tags, you need an option tag with a value attribute -->
        <p>How clean is your house (Rated 1-3 with 3 being cleanest))</p>
        <select name="stars">
        <option value="Great">3</option>
        <option value="Okay">2</option>
        <option value="Bad">1</option>
        </select>




        <p>Any other comments?</p>
        <!-- TEXT AREA -->
        <!-- text area is another input type that has it's own tag -->
        <!-- To work, you have the text area tag with a name attribute, and you can pick the size with rows and cols attributes -->
        <textarea name="name" rows="8" cols="80"></textarea>


        <!-- SUBMIT -->
        <!-- Remember you should have 1 submit per form, the value shows up on the button -->
        <!-- IF you give the submit a name and value, it will save in the URL just like any other type! -->
        <input type="submit" name="" value="Submit Feedback">
