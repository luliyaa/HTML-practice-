<!-- FORM TAG -->
<!-- There is an opening form tag and closing form tag -->
<!-- Every input inside the form tag is what gets 'saved' when you click submit -->
<!-- In general, you will have one form tag and one submit, not multiples! -->
    <form>


        <h1>Log In</h1>
        <h2>Please Input your Password and Email</h2>
    <!-- INPUT TAG -->
    <!-- For the input tag, you can have many different attributes. Attributes are formated type='email' -->
    <!-- There are many type attributes you can select: text, email, name, password, color, etc. Each has different properties -->
        <input type="email" name="useremail" value="Email Here">
        <input type="password" name="password" value="Password">
    <!-- The most important attributes are name and value. The name and value are what gets saved by the form -->
    <!-- The name='' you add in the code -->
    <!-- The value='' can be added by you in the code OR added by the user, so sometimes there isn't a value attribute in the code -->
    <!-- INPUT TYPE SUBMIT -->
        <input type="submit" >
    <!-- The input type 'submit' makes the form collect all the data -->


        <h1>Choose a Color!</h1>
        <h2>Click on the Button when ready</h2>


    <!-- INPUT TYPE COLOR -->
        <input type="color" >
        <h2>Enter some Text!</h2>


    <!-- INPUT TYPE TEXT -->
        <input type="text" name="" value="Text goes here">
    <!-- notice how for the text type, the value shows up in the text box and can be replaced by user generated text -->




    <!-- notice how all these inputs are still within the one form tag, so every input WILL be grabbed -->
    <!-- it doesn't matter where the submit tag is in the page, it will still grab everything contained by the form -->
    </form>
